I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 The Electric State, and wow, my head's spinning like a top on caffeine. The theater was so loud, I couldn't hear my own thoughts over the crunch of popcorn that's somehow now all over my coat. Man, it's like that toddler behind me was droppin' it everywhere. 

The  ? Oh man, where do I even start? Imagine if a robot apocalypse met a summer road trip but with more of those creeping digital shadows and less sunscreen and snacks. I'm still processing that scene with the giant, abandoned robot slumping over like the saddest metal puppy left out in the rain. Felt like even my back ached in sympathy, sitting too long in those cursed seats while my mind wandered through dystopian landscapes.

> I mean, bits and pieces of it blended together like some melted cheese mess. The kid... what was his name again? Michel? Michael? Whatever. He was just there, stumbling through that ghost world, searching for something, for everyone, like I was trying to find my missing phone earlier. The one journeying across a digital wasteland, feeling like a glitchy mix of E.T. but someone plugged it into The Matrix but forgot to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  .

The visuals were insane! Like electric cotton candy got tangled up with a pixelated Van Gogh painting. And that color palette — oof — made me feel things I didn't know jumper cables could evoke, and that nightmare factory of a cityscape kept rewinding in my head like an old VHS tape. 

> I should probably tell you to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   for the little electronic fishies — what on earth were they supposed to be anyway? Did they have a purpose, or were they just eye candy? Whatever, the popcorn stuck in my teeth probably had more relevance to the plot.

Oh, random thought, remember that time we tried playing neon mini-golf with the lights flickering? That's kinda how the battle scenes felt in a good way. Wobbly logic at best, but hey, art mirrors life or whatever they say.

Something about the ending - like a psalm or nothing really, it echoed, like some solemn tune as I tried to remember where I parked. I almost expected to see one of those robots just hanging out by my car. Good thing I didn't drive or anything; would hate for that to be another piece in the Electric scrapbook. 

Well, let's plan to definitely (or maybe not) 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 this one again.

```csharp
int[] bewilderment = new int[capacity];
for (int i = 0; i < popcorn.Length; i++) {
    bewilderment[i] = crumpledScenes[i] + echoes[i];
}
// TODO: refactor emotional breakdown
return lostDigitalFishies;
